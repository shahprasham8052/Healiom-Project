Project is developed using a combination of Python, Flask as the backend technology, and React as the frontend technology.

Steps to Start the Project:

Backend Setup:

Navigate to the "Backend" folder.
Run the "fetch_data.py" file.
This step will initialize a Flask server. It's important to note that the project uses a MongoDB database hosted on Mongo Atlas, a cloud-based service.

Frontend Setup:

Go to the "Frontend" folder, specifically the "find-products" directory.
Open a terminal in this directory.
Install Dependencies:

Run the command "npm install" to install the required dependencies for the frontend.
Start the Application:

After the successful installation of dependencies, execute "npm start" to initiate the frontend server.
Now, you can access the application by navigating to the following link in your web browser:
http://localhost:3000/

This will launch the project and allow you to interact with it.
